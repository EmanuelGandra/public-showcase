# public-showcase
Most of my projects are private due to the use of local and sensitive data, but here I’ll share a bit more about what I’ve developed.

My Data Science and Financial Projects
Over the past few years, I have developed several mini-projects, both for partners of the Ibmec Technology League (IBTECH) — which I co-founded — and for personal development.

Highlights:
MRV Project:
For MRV, a leading Brazilian real estate company, I worked on identifying locations with the highest opportunity cost of investment in the medium and long term.
We developed an Attractiveness Index for the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, combining census data (since 2000), environmental, social, and economic indicators. Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), we built a regional ranking.
The final product was delivered to the company, and the work is currently in the process of publication.

Projects via IBTECH:
We carried out several smaller projects, including:

Automation of internal processes for medium and small companies

Development of automated and integrated payment flows

Generation of automated DREs integrated with proprietary systems

Personal data science projects:
I’ve built models and algorithms for:

Dataset analysis

Vector decomposition

Forecasting methods

Professional Experience
I have been working for 7 months as a Intern at Araujo Fontes (AF Invest), an asset management firm based in Belo Horizonte.
My role includes:

Monitoring macroeconomic trends in Brazil, the US, China, and the EU, as well as geopolitical events and global inflection points.

Supporting the team in hedge management and operation of books (real rates, nominal rates, currencies, and US rates).

Developing internal platforms for:

Trade execution (boletagem) using external databases

Risk management exposure tracking

Fund performance monitoring (cannot share visuals due to sensitive data)

Using Bloomberg Terminal (Lab, BQL) to:

Track fund inflows and outflows

Analyze yield curves and implied inflation

Develop pair correlation studies and historical series analyses

Assisting the macro team with:

Replication and adaptation of FX and output gap models (IFI, XP, BBI)

Visualization of Brazilian and global economic indicators using data from SGS, Sidra, etc.

Participating in Credit and Equities Committees to follow the market and deepen my understanding of different asset classes.

Purpose of this repository
Most of my projects are private due to the use of sensitive data, but i will upload (in the 16/06 - Next Monday ) examples of my work, models, and tools — always using public data or simulated data — that reflect the kind of solutions I’ve developed in real scenarios.
